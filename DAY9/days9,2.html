    <h4><u>Basic structure of html </u></h4>
   <li> HTML documents have a fundamental structure that consists of several essential elements:</li>
<h4>Document Declaration Type</h4>
<li><!DOCTYPE html>: This declaration is placed at the very top of an HTML document. It informs the browser about the type and version of the document, ensuring proper rendering. Omitting this declaration can cause the document to be rendered in "quirks mode," which attempts to mimic older browser behaviors.</li>
<u><h4>Root Element</h4></u>
<li><html>: This is the root element of an HTML document. It encompasses all the content and other HTML elements.</li>
<u><h4>Head Section</h4></u>
<li><head>: This section contains meta-information about the document, such as its title, character set, and links to external resources like stylesheets and scripts. Typical elements within the <head> include:</li>
    <u><h4>Body Section</h4></u>
    <li><body>: This section contains the actual content of the website that is displayed by the browser. All visible elements like paragraphs, headings, images, and other content are placed here.</li>
<u><h4>Heading tags in html</h4></u>
<li>h1: Largest heading
</li>
<li>h2: Second largest heading</li>
<li>h3: Third largest heading</li>
<li>h4: Fouth largest heading</li>
<li>h5: fifth largest or second smallest heading</li>
<li>h6: Smallest heading</li>

<h4><u>anchor tag
    
</u></h4>
</makquee>
<li>Basic Structure: An anchor tag is written as <a></a>. It has an opening tag <a> and a closing tag </a>. The content that goes between these tags becomes the clickable part of the link.</li>
<li>Href Attribute: The most important attribute of an anchor tag is href, which stands for "hypertext reference". It specifies the URL of the page the link goes to. 
</li>
<li>Link Text: The text between the opening and closing <a> tags is what the user sees and clicks on. This is called the link text or anchor text.
</li>
<li>Target Attribute: The target attribute specifies where to open the linked document. It can take values like _blank (opens the linked document in a new window or tab) or _self (opens the linked document in the same frame or tab).
</li>
